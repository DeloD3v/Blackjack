# Blackjack
A basic implementation of blackjack in python.

The project is still immature, several things needed an adjstment, for example the facts that the player have 
the possibility of do a bet after he sees the first card of the dealer or the fact that the dealer play all his 
game even when the player bust or that the function of split still be implemented. However this is just an 
exercise to get the hang with the OOP, so I don't think I'm gonna fix these things. Despite this issues, 
however the game is perfectly enjoyable and works well, so have fun, bye.
